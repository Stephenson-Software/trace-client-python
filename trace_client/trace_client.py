    """Reports usage events to a trace server, and never gets in the way of
    the program doing the reporting.

    Three properties hold for every call to :meth:`report`:

    * **It returns immediately.** The HTTP call happens on a single daemon
      thread owned by this client. A game loop can report from its main
      thread without a frame ever waiting on the network.
    * **It never raises.** A server that is down, slow, or rejecting the key
      is a dropped report, not an exception in the host program. Failures
      are logged at DEBUG on the ``trace`` logger and otherwise not at all.
    * **It is bounded.** At most :attr:`QUEUE_CAPACITY` reports wait to be
      sent; beyond that, new reports are dropped rather than accumulated.
      A trace server that is unreachable for a week costs a few kilobytes,
      not the host's memory.

    Reporting is opt-out: ``enabled=False``, or no key, yields a client that
    does nothing and costs nothing. So does the environment: the constructor
    checks ``TRACE_USAGE_REPORTING=off`` and ``DO_NOT_TRACK=1`` before it
    looks at ``enabled``, so a user can switch off every trace-reporting
    program at once. :attr:`disabled_reason` says which of those applied
    (``"environment"``, ``"config"`` or ``"no key"``; ``None`` when on) so
    the program can say so in its notice. Programs that run on other
    people's machines should expose that switch in their settings and say
    so once, pointing at
    https://github.com/Stephenson-Software/trace#usage-reporting.

    Every event carries the program's own version as the tag ``version`` --
    the third argument, required, so a ``command`` event can be tied to a
    release as well as a ``startup`` one. An event's own ``version`` tag wins
    over it.
