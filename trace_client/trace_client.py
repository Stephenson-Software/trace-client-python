    """Reports usage events to a trace server, and never gets in the way of
    the program doing the reporting.

    Three properties hold for every call to :meth:`report`:

    * **It returns immediately.** The HTTP call happens on a single daemon
      thread owned by this client. A game loop can report from its main
      thread without a frame ever waiting on the network.
    * **It never raises.** A server that is down, slow, or rejecting the key
      is a dropped report, not an exception in the host program. Failures
      are logged at DEBUG on the ``trace`` logger and otherwise not at all.
    * **It is bounded.** At most :attr:`QUEUE_CAPACITY` reports wait to be
      sent; beyond that, new reports are dropped rather than accumulated.
      A trace server that is unreachable for a week costs a few kilobytes,
      not the host's memory.

    Reporting is opt-out: ``enabled=False``, or no key, yields a client that
    does nothing and costs nothing. Programs that run on other people's
    machines should expose that switch in their settings and say so once.
